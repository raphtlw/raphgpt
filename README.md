This is raphGPT, a multi-modal Telegram bot built on top of the OpenAI API as a tool that @raphtlw can use to make tasks and communication move faster.

## Develop

Prerequisites:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
- idk, maybe a good computer to run all the video processing stuff?

Launch a new terminal and run:

```shell
docker compose watch
```

It should start building Dockerfiles in telegram-bot and video-parser.

Auto-refreshes when changes are made.

## Contributing

Make a PR and I will review it.
